a.
I have made 4 commits to the repository.

b.
the .gitignore file was last modified when properties.txt was added to it.

c.
first, you can use this command to get the most recent file made before the given date:
kyrellosibrahim@Kyrelloss-MacBook-Air GitFall2024-Kyrellos % git rev-list -n 1 --before="2024-09-13" HEAD
after that, you can use the given hash code to list all the files that were present at the time.
kyrellosibrahim@Kyrelloss-MacBook-Air GitFall2024-Kyrellos % git ls-tree cca9550f2da29daeb93233f506be2b02394b5bcc --name-only
BookShop.java
Main.java
README.md
book.txt
inspiration.txt

d.
to see how many times the files in a src folder were modified you use the method:
git log --pretty=format: --name-only --stat -- src | grep -E 'src/' | sort | uniq -c
however, this project doesn't have a src folder, so i will check all the modified files:
git log --pretty=format: --name-only --stat -- ./ | grep -E '^[^/]+$' | sort | uniq -c

e.
there is no REMOVE.txt file in this repository, so I cannot answer this question. However,
I can try and answer this question for the README file instead.
if you do the command " % git log --stat -- README.md"
it shows us "1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)"

f.
git log shows the history of commits and changes, which mention the author, date, and message.
git status shows everything that you would need to know before committing a change. it shows
changes to be committed, files that were modified, and untracked files.

g.
git shortlog makes the view much shorter. it sorts by author, how many commits they have made,
and the message with each commit.

h.
to check each commit where main.java was part of the commit, you do the function
git log -- Main.java

i.
to check each commit where main.java was involved, including renames and diffs,
you do the function git log --follow -p -- Main.java

j.
to check each commit where "account" was in the commit message, you use the function
git log --grep="account"

k.
to check all commits made by a certain author, you use the function
git log --author="Kyrellos Ibrahim"
change out my name for any authors name to see their commits.

l.
to check commits by Lauren between 01/05/2024 and 01/14/2024, you use the function
git log --author="Lauren" --since="2014-01-05" --until="2024-01-14"
